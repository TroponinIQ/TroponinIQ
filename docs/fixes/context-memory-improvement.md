# Context Memory Improvement - Production Fix

## Issue Summary

**User Feedback**: "The AI agent forgets too quickly" - users reported that the agent would lose track of previous conversation context, leading to repetitive questions and loss of coaching continuity.

## Root Cause Analysis

The AI agent was artificially limiting conversation context to only **6 messages**, despite:
- Loading 40 messages from the database
- Using Claude 4 Sonnet with 200,000 token context window
- Having plenty of room for more conversation history

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic)
```typescript
// Only used last 6 messages in AI prompt
conversationHistory?.slice(-6)

// Context estimation was outdated
totalChars += 5000; // System prompt estimate too low
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
// Now uses last 30 messages for better continuity
conversationHistory?.slice(-30)

// Updated context estimation for larger context
totalChars += 8000; // More accurate system prompt + knowledge base estimate
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Context Window
- **Previous**: 6 messages
- **New**: 30 messages
- **Impact**: 5x more conversation history retained

### 2. Updated Token Estimation
- Added comprehensive documentation of model limits
- Updated estimates for system prompt and knowledge base
- Better monitoring thresholds for context usage

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
```typescript
// Warning at 100k tokens (~78% of GPT limit, ~50% of Claude limit)
if (estimatedTokens > 100000) {
  console.log('⚠️ High context usage detected');
}

// Critical warning at 150k tokens
if (estimatedTokens > 150000) {
  console.log('🚨 Very high context usage');
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/ai/prompts.ts`** - Increased context from 6 to 30 messages
2. **`lib/ai/hybrid-agent.ts`** - Updated deprecated context handling
3. **`app/api/chat/agent/route.ts`** - Enhanced token estimation and monitoring

## Model Context Limits

| Model | Context Limit | Estimated Characters |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Claude 4 Sonnet | 200,000 tokens | ~800,000 characters |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 200,000 tokens | ~800,000 characters |
| GPT-4o Mini | 128,000 tokens | ~512,000 characters |
| GPT-5 Mini | 128,000 tokens | ~512,000 characters |

## Expected User Impact

### Positive Changes
- ✅ **Better coaching continuity** - Agent remembers longer conversations
- ✅ **Fewer repetitive questions** - Agent recalls previous answers
- ✅ **Enhanced personalization** - Better context for ongoing coaching relationships
- ✅ **Improved user satisfaction** - More natural conversation flow

### Potential Considerations
- 📊 **Slightly higher token usage** - But well within model limits
- ⚡ **Minimal performance impact** - Modern models handle this efficiently
- 💰 **Negligible cost increase** - Context is cheap compared to output tokens

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Production Deploy
- [ ] Test with long conversations (20+ exchanges)
- [ ] Verify agent remembers context from early in conversation
- [ ] Monitor token usage in development
- [ ] Test edge cases near context limits

### Post-Deploy Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor context token usage logs
- [ ] Track user satisfaction metrics
- [ ] Watch for any performance degradation
- [ ] Collect user feedback on memory improvements

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert by changing:
```typescript
// Rollback to previous context size
conversationHistory?.slice(-6)
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Context token usage stays under 100k for 95% of conversations
- No timeout or performance degradation
- Successful conversation continuity across 20+ message exchanges

### User Experience Metrics
- Reduced complaints about "forgetting" 
- Improved coaching session ratings
- Longer conversation sessions (indicating better engagement)
- Fewer instances of users repeating information

---

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Production**  
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **Low** (Non-breaking change, conservative token usage)  
**Expected Impact**: 🟢 **High Positive** (Addresses major user pain point)

*This fix directly addresses user feedback and should significantly improve the coaching experience by maintaining conversation context over longer sessions.*
