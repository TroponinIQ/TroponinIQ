## Test Execution Guide

1. **Run tests in fresh chat sessions** to avoid context contamination
2. **Test with different user profiles** to validate personalization
3. **Monitor console logs** for token usage and warnings
4. **Compare with pre-fix behavior** if possible
5. **Document any unexpected responses** for further refinement

**Priority Order:**
1. Response cutoff testing (critical bug fix)
2. PED guidance testing (critical functionality)  
3. Profile integration testing (user experience)
4. Formatting and voice testing (quality)
5. Edge cases and regression testing (stability)
